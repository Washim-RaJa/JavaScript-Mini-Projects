## Introduction
This is a basic and fully responsive Calculator project developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to run the project.
- Download the zip file and extract it in your system.
- Make sure you're connected to the internet so that the "Font Awesome" icons get fetched properly which I have used in this project for better look.

- Open the root directory of this project with a "Text Editor" and run it with its live server.

## Features

- This a basic calculator project which can perform  basic arithmatic operations like `Division`, `Multiplication`, `Addition`, `Subtraction` as well as finding `Percentage` and `Remainder`.

- It has a `clear` button which will reset all the data at once and a `delete` button which will delete input data one at a time. the buttons are at the top left of the calculator.

- I have also added toggle theme mode functionality in this project through which we can change the theme from `lightmode` to `darkmode` and vice versa.

- By clicking the button at the bottom left of the calculator you can toggle the theme. the default theme mode is set to lightmode.

- In case of any invalid mathematical opretion or input this calculator will display a `syntax error` message as I have done the error handling part also.

- I have also added a functionality so that the calculator can also be operated by Keyboard.
