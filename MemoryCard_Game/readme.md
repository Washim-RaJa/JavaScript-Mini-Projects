## Introduction
This is a fully responsive Memory Card Game project developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to run the project.
- Download the zip file and extract it in your system.
- Make sure you're connected to the internet so that the images and svg files that I have used in this project get fetched properly.

- Open the root directory of this project with a "Text Editor" and run it with its live server.

## Features

- As soon as you run the game, a timer will start which is used here to show how much time is taken to complete the game.

- On flipping two cards each time the number of `Moves` gets updated.

- On successful matching of two cards the `Matched Count` gets updated.

- On successful matching of all cards the `Score` will be shown and the `Timer` will stop finally.

- The `Score` is evaluated based on `(Matched Count/Moves)% of 10`. Since the full score is 10.

- Click the `Restart Game` button to restart the game.
