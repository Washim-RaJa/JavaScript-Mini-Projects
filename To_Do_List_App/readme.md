## Introduction
This is a basic and fully responsive ToDo List project developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to run the project.
- Download the zip file and extract it in your system.
- Make sure you're connected to the internet so that the "Font Awesome" icons get fetched properly which I have used in this project for better look.

- Open the root directory of this project with a "Text Editor" and run it with its live server.
